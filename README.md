### About
I am a professional cloud and systems engineer with a passion for using technology to solve business problems. As a cloud and systems engineer with over 5 years of experience, I have a strong track record of providing cloud solutions to clients, ensuring the delivery of quality services to end users while supporting and maintaining the infrastructure and applications.
 
I have experience with cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and DigitalOcean, as well as implementing DevOps principles and the ability to build CI/CD pipeline from the ground up using the Bitbucket pipeline, GitHub actions, and Azure pipeline. I have a proven ability to troubleshoot technical issues, optimize system performance, and provide ongoing support and maintenance for systems. I collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and cross-functional teams to understand business requirements, plans, design architectures, and deployment strategies with little or no supervision while managing and leading projects to successful delivery in an agile environment.
